# How is Classical Tibetan pronounced?

This section is aimed at users who are looking for the right way to phoneticize Classical Tibetans, not to linguists who are aware of the perils of the exercise.

For an overview of the history of the Tibetic languages see Bialek 2022 and [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/clas1254).

Classical Tibetan is the language used in the vast majority of litterary texts composed in Tibetan until the second half of the XXth c. It is a language that is used daily by millions of people for reading, recitation, composition, etc. It is also a language that is pronounced in a great variety of ways, sometimes not inter-intellegible. These different pronounciations are transparently inspired by the phonology of the native language of the user: Classical Tibetan pronounced in Lhasa has phonetic features taken from modern standard Tibetan, Classical Tibetan pronounced in Kham has features of the Khampa variety of the user, etc.

The usual methoology to determine the phonetics of Classical Tibetan would be to record native speakers. Unfortunately for us, noone has used Classical Tibetan as their native language (to communicate with their parents) for centuries. It is thus impossible to determine the phonetics of the original Classical Tibetan spoken around the XIIth century. Eeven if it was, it would probably be too distinct from the way modern users are pronouncing to be relevant to the issue of the pronounciation of religious prayers in the West.

We are thus left with different types of exercise:

##### Historical research

Research in historical phonology of Tibetan is a field that sees regular important contributions (as in [this example](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4qd7k36j)). It is very unlikely though that any tentative reconstruction of Classical Tibetan phonetics will have any relevance to the traditional religious institutions or any resemblance to their pronounciation.

We could also argue that even though texts are written in Classical Tibetan, if they are recent enough their authors would have recited them using a pronounciation that would be very different from the historical pronounciation.

##### Negociating with institutions

Traditional institutions (such as Buddhist communities) often have a specific culture of pronounciation of Classical Tibetan, despite being often very heterogeneous in that regard. They typically struggle to produce phonetics of the texts they recite because of different aspects that we will describe in
- pronouncing_sanskrit
- levels_of_language
- pronouncing_tibetan_in_the_west
